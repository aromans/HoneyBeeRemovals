        "Swarming is the honey bee’s natural method of colony reproduction. The old queen and about half of the worker bees leave their former nest and seek a new home, usually in the spring but sometimes at other times of the year. To start the process, worker bees called “scouts,” begin to canvass the surrounding territory for a potential new nesting site even before the swarm leaves its original colony."

        "Sometimes, the “scouts” will find a suitable nesting site in the walls of your home, garage, or shed. The “scouts” look for a small entrance to a warm, dry 1.5 – 2.0 cubic feet volume. This  might result from missing insulation during construction of the home or another volume."

        "Extracting honey bees from buildings can be difficult and it is important the honeybee colony is removed properly. If the colony is well established, unattended brood (larvae) can  rot and become very odorous. Unattended honey stores can absorb moisture and ferment, creating gas that causes the cells to burst. Honey then seeps through the drywall, leading to large amounts of cleanup."

        "Following extraction of honey bees the odor of beeswax remains. Because honey bees have an extremely acute sense of smell, that odor will be noticeable from a long distance and highly attractive to any future honey bee scouts seeking new nesting sites. It is important that the beeswax is removed and the area is prepared to prevent another colony from moving in."
